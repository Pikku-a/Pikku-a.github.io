## To do
- Online notebook synchronization
- Start using avif format for comics and maybe for some other stuff (but not games and other commercial stuff)
- Make a script that automates RSS feed. It would have to be run before updating the site.
Organizing:
- Rename image folder to media or something else to indicate that there is other stuff too?
- Change "profile" folder to "contact"?
- Move games to "games" folder?
- Move and change "art-portfolio" to "portfolio/art"?
- Change location of translation files, because there is only one in a whole "text" folder
