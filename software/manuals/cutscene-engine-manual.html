<p>CUTSCENE ENGINE MANUAL<br /><br />Welcome to use Cutscene engine!<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />CONTENTS<br />- Get started<br />- Simple step-by-step guide<br />- "Internal" scripts<br />- Dialogue<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Changing default settings of dialogue<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Smart line break configuration<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Using Draw GUI for dialogue<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Using Cutscene engine with Dialogue engine<br />- Custom scripts<br />- About unfinished scripts<br />- Updating the asset<br />- Tutorials<br />- Contact<br />- Other<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Showcasing your games<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Becoming a tester<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />GET STARTED<br />To get started take a look to the example rooms.<br /><br />Go to the creation code of the control_cutscene objects (double-click the object -&gt; creation code).<br />There you can see examples of how to use it.<br />You may want to try modifying that code, changing some scripts or arguments and then running the game.<br /><br />Then you may want to know how to use the scripts. There are more than 30! So how to use them?<br />In each script there is an explanation about what it does. There you can also see what arguments it needs.<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />SIMPLE STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE<br />1. Add a control_cutscene object to the room<br />2. Make sure there is a layer called "hud" in the room<br />3. Double-click the control_cutscene object in the room<br />4. Open the creation code<br />5. Set these variables:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- cutscene_id (different for all cutscenes in the same room)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- cutscene_player (if cutscene_mode is collision, the collision is checked for this object) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- cutscene_mode ("collision" or "immediate")<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- persist (true or false)<br />6. Set the 2d array "scene_info" with all the scripts that constitute the cutscene<br />7. Here is an example (more are in the example room):<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cutscene_id = 0;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cutscene_player = example_player;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cutscene_mode = "collision";<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;persist = false;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;scene_info = [<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[cutscene_play_sound,sound_alarm,1],<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[cutscene_wait,1],<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[cutscene_move_object,example_player,170,300,2],<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[cutscene_dialogue_style,noone,c_black,c_white,c_white,1,example_font,noone,true,example_continue1],<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[cutscene_dialogue,"What was that?"]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;];<br />In this example, the cutscene starts when example_player collides with control_cutscene. The cutscene plays a sound, waits for a second, moves an object and shows dialogue.<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />"INTERNAL" SCRIPTS<br />Ignore them. They take care of themselves.<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />DIALOGUE<br />Cutscene engine has lots of scripts to show text and dialogue. The script names start with "cutscene_dialogue_".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CHANGING DEFAULT SETTINGS OF DIALOGUE<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you don't want to call the script cutscene_dialogue_style, cutscene_dialogue_keys, cutscene_dialogue_sprite etc.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;everytime you add dialogue, you can change the default settings in the control_cutscene object.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you go to the create event of that object, you will find a "SETTINGS AREA" where you can change variables.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SMART LINE BREAK CONFIGURATION<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Recently I added a new optional argument to cutscene_dialogue_style: smart line breaks.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This prevents text from changing line in the middle of a word. However, this is still an experimental<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;feature and doesn't work correctly on all projects. If you want to use this feature in your project but<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;it doesn't work correctly, you can try this:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to textbox_draw script. Change the variable called linebreak_addition to something else<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(for example: 0, -5 or -10). It's completely possible that this doesn't fix it and you will not be able<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;to use this feature. However, I tried to use this feature in 4 different projects and in 3 of them changing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;this variable helped (on 1 project it didn't work at all).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;USING DRAW GUI<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Using Draw GUI to draw the dialogue hasn't been tested a lot yet, so I recommend using the normal Draw event.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But if you want to use it, follow these instructions:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Go to the textbox object.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Change the Draw event to Draw GUI.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Change the draw_gui variable there to true.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Things to note:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember that using cutscene_dialogue_position is of course different when using Draw GUI.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When using Draw GUI, your camera size and viewport size should be the same, otherwise clicking options with mouse will not work well.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;USING CUTSCENE ENGINE WITH DIALOGUE ENGINE<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I also have a Dialogue engine (https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/6657/dialogue-engine-text-boxes).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are using both engines together, you will notice that some objects and scripts have the same name.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You can delete the duplicates.<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />CUSTOM SCRIPTS<br />You can make your own scripts too. When the thing the script is supposed to do is done, call cutscene_next().<br />See the other scripts for examples.<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />ABOUT UNFINISHED SCRIPTS<br />Some scripts might not work correctly yet, for example cutscene_skip.<br />These will be fixed / updated in the future.<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />UPDATING THE ASSET<br />NOTE! If you update the asset from your asset library, if the control_cutscene object gets updated,<br />Gamemaker will probably remove it from all rooms, and your cutscenes might get removed too.<br />So if you for some reason want to update it, I recommend doing a backup first.<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />TUTORIALS<br />There are some simple tutorials (only one currently...) for this engine on my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzKIFNtRA1A2r3cJB8alHYw<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />CONTACT<br />If you need more help or want to suggest a feature, you can email me. See link to contact page below.<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />OTHER<br />This engine will improve over time and more features will be added.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SHOWCASING YOUR GAMES<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have you made a game using this Cutscene engine?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If so, you can email me a link to the game and I might showcase it on my website or in the marketplace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;BECOMING A TESTER<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Would you like to try new features earlier? Email me to become a tester for Cutscene engine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(and Dialogue engine too if you own it). You will also get one of my games for free every time you have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;tested an update, when the update is published.</p>
